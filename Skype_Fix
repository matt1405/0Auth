#For customer you are moving to modern auth Skype for business will fail to connect  (well it did for us )
#Install the PowerShell module for Sfb:
#https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39366

#run powershell as admin:

Set-executionpolicy remotesigned
#then
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -UserName user@domain.com
Import-PSSession $sfboSession

#Check modern auto isn’t already on –
get-CsOAuthConfiguration

#expect the results will be 
#ClientAdalAuthOverride : Disallowed
#So then run 

Set-CsOAuthConfiguration -ClientAdalAuthOverride Allowed

#Then check using 

get-CsOAuthConfiguration

#ClientAdalAuthOverride should now be allowed
#Can take up to 24hours apparently but it took 30mins for skype to work again for me
